# StiefelInjRadius

The scripts in this repository realize the numerical experiments associated with the publication

  J. Stoye, R. Zimmermann
  "On the Injectivity Radius of the Stiefel Manifold: Numerical investigations and an explicit construction of a cut point at short distance", 
  arXiv:2403.03782, March 2024.


We made use of functions for the Stiefel Exponential and the Stiefel Logarithm derived in:

  R. Zimmermann, K. H\"uper
  "Computing the Riemannian logarithm on the Stiefel manifold: metrics, methods and performance", 
  arXiv:2103.12046, March 2022.


To run this scripts, you need the files 'Stiefel_Exp_Log.py' and 'Stiefel_Aux.py' from the repository 

    https://github.com/RalfZimmermannSDU/RiemannStiefelLog
    
associated to the publication

  R. Zimmermann, K. H\"uper
  "Computing the Riemannian logarithm on the Stiefel manifold: metrics, methods and performance", 
  arXiv:2103.12046, March 2022
  
as they contain functions for the Stiefel Exponential and Stiefel Logarithm.
