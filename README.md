# StiefelInjRadius

The scripts in this repository realize the numerical experiments associated with the publication


We made use of functions for the Stiefel Exponential and the Stiefel Logarithm derived in:

  R. Zimmermann, K. H\"uper.
  "Computing the Riemannian logarithm on the Stiefel manifold: metrics, methods and performance", 
  arXiv:2103.12046, March 2022


To run this scripts one needs the files 'Stiefel_Exp_Log.py' and 'Stiefel_Aux.py' from the repository 

    https://github.com/RalfZimmermannSDU/RiemannStiefelLog
    
associated to the publication

  R. Zimmermann, K. H\"uper.
  "Computing the Riemannian logarithm on the Stiefel manifold: metrics, methods and performance", 
  arXiv:2103.12046, March 2022
as they contain functions for the Stiefel Exponential and Stiefel Logarithm.
